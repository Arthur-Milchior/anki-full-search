There are two Boolean options to configure:
* "sort field": If you want to sort using `Sort field`, set it to True. Otherwise, set it to `false` to save space. The default configuration of anki corresponds to `true`.
* "full search": Whether to allow search in every fields. Set it to `false` to save space. Set it to `true` to use this add-on.
* "default": set to false to use this add-on, and true to use anki's normal setting.
